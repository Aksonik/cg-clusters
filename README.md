# CG-clusters

### The repository is to determine and analyze clusters in a coarse grained simulation.

```
python main.py -c file.dat -f frame -s file.pdb -t file.dcd
```


-c file.dat contains parameters (A,C and R) for a contact criterion:

#### Contact criterion
Two molecules are assumed to be in contact if the distance between them is less than *d*:

*d* = *A* ( R<sub>A</sub> + R<sub>B</sub> ) + *D*

where R is a double radius of a molecule.

## OUTPUT:
1. Cluster size distribution.
2. PDB with wrapped clusters.
3. PDB with center of geometry of the clusters.
4. Radial distribution function for each cluster and each molecule type.

## What else does it need?
